In this project, I am implementing the Flow language.

The Flow language is language inspired by rust, golang, haskell and high-order effect systems. Synthacsitically it very similar to rust.

Unlike Rust, this language has:
- GC
- type system supports HKT
- support for effects (algebraic, scoped, maybe latent and parallel)
- runtime with green threads similar to Haskell and Golang
- traits here are more like typeclasses in Haskell

## Structure
All Haskell packages are located in the `./pkgs` directory.
Language design is located in `./design` directory.
Language surface AST and parser located in `./pkgs/parser` directory.
