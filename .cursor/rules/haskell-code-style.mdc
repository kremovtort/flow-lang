- All imports use explicit package names except from current package, eg `import "text" Data.Text (Text)`
- All imports are either explicit or qualified, eg `import Data.Text (Text)` or `import Data.Text qualified as Text`
- Collection types imported as `Data.Vector (Vector)` and their operations as `Data.Vector qualified as Vector`, so import qualification of collection operations should be the same as the collection type or qualified as submodule of the collection type, eg `Data.Text qualified as Text` or `Data.Text.Encoding qualified as Text.Encoding`
- Lazy types should be imported with `Lazy` prefix, eg `Data.Text.Lazy qualified as Lazy (Text)` for type and `Data.Text.Lazy qualified as Lazy.Text` for operations
- that kinds of imports delimeted by empty line and ordered as follows:
  1. prelude imports
  2. imports from foreign packages
  3. import from other packages of current project
  4. imports from current package
